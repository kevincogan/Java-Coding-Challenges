# Java Coding Challenges

## Overview

The **Java Coding Challenges** repository is a collection of Java programs designed to solve various algorithmic and logical problems. This repository serves as a resource for practicing Java programming and understanding key concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, file handling, and more. Each file addresses a unique challenge, ranging from simple tasks like converting units to more complex problems like implementing generic algorithms.

## Features

- **Variety of Challenges**: From basic tasks to advanced algorithms, catering to all skill levels.
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world inspired problems to enhance programming skills.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Demonstrates Java's object-oriented features in solving problems.
- **File Handling**: Examples of reading from and writing to files.
- **Collections and Generics**: Usage of Java collections framework and generic programming.

## Project Structure

The repository contains multiple Java files, each representing a standalone coding challenge. Below is a sample of the challenges included:

### Example Challenges

1. **Above Average**: Calculates if a set of numbers is above the average.
2. **ArrayClass**: Demonstrates basic array operations.
3. **Bank Account**: Simulates basic banking operations using object-oriented programming.
4. **Convert**: Converts between different units (e.g., inches to centimeters).
5. **Generic Max**: Finds the maximum value in a generic list.
6. **Group Students**: Groups students based on certain criteria.
7. **Hangman**: Implements the classic Hangman game.
8. **Reading and Writing Files**: Demonstrates file input/output operations.
9. **HashSet**: Utilizes the Java `HashSet` for storing unique elements.
10. **Square It**: Squares a given number or array of numbers.

## Prerequisites

To run the programs, you need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
- A code editor or IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevincogan/Java-Coding-Challenges.git
   cd Java-Coding-Challenges
   ```

2. **Compile and Run**:
   Compile and run any Java file using the command line or an IDE. For example:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Explore Files**:
   Browse the repository to select a challenge you want to work on.

2. **Run the Program**:
   Each file is self-contained and can be compiled and executed independently.

3. **Understand and Modify**:
   Read through the code to understand the logic. Modify the files to experiment and enhance your learning.
